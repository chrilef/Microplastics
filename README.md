All scripts have been developed for a BSc Honours (Bioinformatics) project at the University of Pretoria. 

Developer: Christophe Lefebvre 
Supervisor: Prof. Thulani Makhalanyane
Co-supervisor: Dr. Oliver Mogase

Disclaimer: I do not own any of the tools used in the scripts and will cite them in the future. 

--- Usage --- 
These scripts will be used to create a metagenomic workflow for the analysis of plastic & microplastic degrading microbes in the ocean. Currently, the code is very explicit and automation will be done in the future. The overall aim is to find the distribution, diversity, and functional capacity of plastic degrading microbes in the oceans.
